# Classification-and-Detection-of-Cyber-attack-in-Digital-Forensics-by-using-Django-Framework.
To find the Cyber attack in Digital Forensics with the help of Machine Learning and Django Framework.
Our Proposed scheme is used to find the cyber attack in digital forensics by using randomforest of machine learning algorithm and Django Framework.
Here, we use the five module to implement our article they are Datasets collection, Datasets Pre-Processing, Model implementation of Machine Learning algorithm, Web application and Final Prediction.
First Module is Datasets Collection, here the datas are collected in the kagle website with the features like lot of information about cyber and then then the target output name is Normal, Web Crawling attack, Port Scan attack, Brute Fource attack.
Second Module is Data Preprocessing module is used to preprocess the data into the proper format of the system.
Third Module is the Model Implementation module, here the machine learning algorithm of random forest are used to train the data and shown the accuracy score of the data.
Fourth Module is the Web application module, here the Django framework is used to create the web of the features like register page, login page and prediction page.
Fifth Module is the Final prediction module, user enter the features of cyber data in digital forensics and then user click the predict button and then final prediction shown the any one of the features like Normal, Web Crawling attack, Port Scan attack, Brute Fource attack.
